## How do I approach designing software?
#### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Using OpenGL in this final project has increased my overall knowledge and hands on experience with the API. I have been able to home in on my design skills especially when creating and rendering 3D objects, applying textures/shaders, and applying realistic lighting to create a visually appealing 3D environment. 

#### What design process did you follow for your project work?
Throughout the project, I followed a design process that involved conceptualizing the scene, planning the placement of objects, selecting appropriate textures and shaders, and iteratively refining the details to achieve the desired visual outcome.

#### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The design approach I adopted, involving meticulous planning and iterative refinement, can be valuable in future projects by helping me create well-organized and visually captivating scenes.

## How do I approach developing programs?
#### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I was able to use some new development strategies while working on the final project, such as modular coding for the creation of 3D objects, textures, lighting, and shaders. I was also able to use an iterative development strategy to constantly improve and evolve my project.

#### How did iteration factor into your development?
As previously discussed, iteration was huge in my project. My main strategy was to get the bare bones functionality that I needed for my project run, and then from there I constantly improved and iterated on that initial state until my project became more polished and complex. 

#### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
Throughout milestones, I transitioned from a basic understanding of OpenGL to a more nuanced grasp of shaders, lighting techniques, and efficient rendering, ultimately coming together in the creation in my complex 3D scene.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you knew knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations provided me with a deep understanding of how mathematical concepts translate into 3D visual representations, enhancing my analytical and problem-solving abilities for future educational pursuits.

#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you knew knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The skills acquired in computational graphics and visualizations, including shader programming, optimization techniques, and 3D modeling, offer me a strong foundation applicable to a variety of professional fields, such as game development or software development. Which are two fields I am highly interested in pursuing in my professional career.
